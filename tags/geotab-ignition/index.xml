      <description>This project was a submission in the Safe Roads Competition 2021 hosted by SAS, Geotab and Toronto Police Services. The objective of this submission was to investigate factors that contributed to vehicle collisions with cyclists, and the impact of driving behaviour and compliance with traffic regulations on cyclist safety.
The data used for this study was from the KSI (Killed or Seriously Injured) dataset provided by the Toronto Police services and additional data from the Geotab Ignition hazardous areas and road impediments dataset were used.</description>
